# steganography
This program takes a string input and converts it into unicode. The unicode is then used to manipulate the 2^8 tuples of the PNG - if the unicode is 1, the tuple value is converted to odd and if the unicode is 0, the value is converted to even. There is an end of message value that is hard coded to alert the program to the message's end.
